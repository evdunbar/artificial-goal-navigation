# What Is Our Extension?
- bees (and probably other insects) have been shown to share the location of food sources through dances and other methods
- this corresponds to sharing the global vector
- we can simulate this by transplanting a noisy version of one insects global direction neurons into another
- using this, we can find an upper bound on neural noise for this process, found by artificial insects losing their ability to locate the described food source
